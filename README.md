Hey Folks,
Wouldn't it be interesting if you are out on a vacation and a simple hardware like arduino can water our plants working just on a powerbank for days at a time?

Indeed, this is why this project was created....!

## Prerequisites--
---
### Libraries-
1. Narcoleptic- It helps put arduino into ultra power saving mode which is all, required for it to last several days.


### Hardware-
1. Arduino
2. Powerbank
3. Water pump/motors
4. Jumper cables
5. Tubes to carry water from water tank/source.
---

## Important Steps To Be Taken before Deploying this-
1. The coded line `Narcoleptic.delay(4000)` stands for how long would you want the water pump to despense water. This can be calculated according to your water requirement of the plant.
2. A 12V DC motor is recomended for this project.
